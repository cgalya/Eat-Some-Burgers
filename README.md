# Eat Some Burgers!

Eat Some Burgers! is a web application that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern, uses Node and MySQL to query and route data , and Handlebars generats the HTML.

Eat Some Burger! allows users to enter the name of a burger and see it appear in the "Burgers Available for Eating" list.  When a user clicks on the "Devour Burger!" button next to their chosen burger, the burger moves from the available list to the "Burgers Previously Enjoyed List".
